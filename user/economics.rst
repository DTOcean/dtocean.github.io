Economics Module
----------------


The 'economic assessment' module takes the array configuration determined by the
design modules (hydrodynamics, Electrical Sub-Systems, Moorings and
Foundations, Installation, Operations and Maintenance) and estimates the LCOE
for the project. The LCOE is the indicator used for benchmarking different
possible solutions, and the global optimisation routine objective is to
minimise it. 

Within each design module there are economic functions that calculate the
lifetime costs of the corresponding subsystem. These will be used as input for
the LCOE calculation. 


Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'economic assessment' module is composed of a set of functions that are used
to calculate the LCOE, which can be called separately or as a whole. The
functions and their interactions with the inputs are presented in a
diagrammatic form in :numref:`fig-economic`.

Inputs
''''''

The Economics module requires inputs from other modules and from the user. Note
that the inputs from other modules can always be overwritten by the user.

The Bill of Materials is generated by the core from the outputs of the other
design modules. It is formatted as a pandas tables, with the following fields:

 * **item**: identifier column, not used in the function
 * **quantity**: number of units of item
 * **unitary_cost**: cost per unit of the item. It assumes that it matches the
   units of the quantity
 * **project_year**: year relative to the start of the project when the cost
   occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)

The second set of inputs generated by the tool relates to the energy production.
It also formatted as a pandas table, with the following columns

 * **project_year**: year relative to the start of the project when the cost
   occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)
 * **energy**: final annual energy output. This value accounts for the
   hydrodynamic interaction, transmission losses and downtime losses

The project_capacity input, referring to project capacity in MW, is an output
from the Array Hydrodynamic module, by using the number of devices output and
the user input on device rating.

The inputs a_energy_wo_elosses and a_energy_wo_availability are outputs from the
the Array hydrodynamic and Electrical sub-systems modules, respectively. The
input a_energy_wo_elosses indicates the average annual unconstrained energy
production, before electrical losses; while a_energy_wo_availability indicates
the average annual energy production accounting for electrical losses, but
without accounting for availability. 

From the user, the following inputs are required:

 * **project_lifetime**: duration of the project in number of years
 * **discount_rate**: discount rate for the project in analysis. The discount
   rate is dependent on the investor’s valuation of risk and other investment
   opportunities.


Outputs
'''''''

The main output of the economics theme module is the levelized cost of energy
(LCOE) of the project, expressed in €/MW. The building blocks of the LCOE
calculation, CAPEX, OPEX and Annual Energy Production, are also outputs of the
module

This allows for the representation of the contribution of CAPEX and OPEX to the
LCOE, or the contribution of each sub-system/module.
