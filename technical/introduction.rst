Introduction
============

Purpose of the Design Tools
---------------------------

Technical Design and Assessment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The software generated by DTOcean project automates the design of a feasible
array of ocean energy converters (OECs) for a relevant geographical location
and technology type. The design process is modularised into the following
stages:

 * **Hydrodynamics**: designs the layout of converters in a chosen region and
   calculates their power output
 * **Electrical Sub-Systems**: designs an electrical layout for the given
   converter locations and calculates the electrical energy exported to shore
 * **Moorings and Foundations**: designs the foundations and moorings
   required to secure the converters at their given locations
 * **Installation**: designs the installation plan for the energy converters
   and the components required to satisfy the electrical sub-system and
   moorings and foundations designs
 * **Operations and Maintenance**:  calculates the required maintenance
   actions and power losses resulting from the operation of the converters over
   the lifetime of the array

The software can evaluate each stage of the design, and the design as a whole,
using three thematic assessments. These are:

 * **Economics**: produces economic indicators for the design, in particular
   the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE)
 * **Reliability**: assesses the reliability of the components in the design
   over the array lifetime
 * **Environmental**: assesses the environmental impact of each stage of the
   design

The challenge and ultimate goal of the project is to optimise the designs
created by the software, against a suitable metric, chosen as the LCOE.


Optimisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each of design stages described above can operate independently, given the
necessary input data is satisfied. To ensure a result when each module is run
independently from other stages of the design, it must conform to a local
optimisation criterion. Thus, for each stage, these criteria are:

 * **Hydrodynamics**: power generation of the converters
 * **Electrical Sub-Systems**: capital cost of components vs electrical power
   losses
 * **Moorings and Foundations**: capital cost of components
 * **Installation**: cost of installation of OEC devices and components
 * **Operations and Maintenance**:  cost of maintenance activities vs
   electrical power losses

When running all the stages of the design to get an optimal solution, then a
global decision tool is required to manipulate the solutions and operation of
the modules to approach the global optimum, as the local optimisation routines
at each stage cannot achieve this purpose.

Components of the Design Tools
------------------------------

A general overview of the structure of the software and a complete description
of the computational components is found in :ref:`designreq`. The key components
that are defined there can be summarised as follows:

 * **Core**: The core describes the main interface between the computational
   modules, thematic algorithms and the database. 
 * **Database**: The database contains long standing reference data and data
   relating to particular array design projects. 
 * **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI provides an easy to use method
   for the user of the design tools to interact with the components described
   above. 
 * **Computational Modules**: The programmatic description of the design
   stages detailed above. 
 * **Thematic Algorithms**: The programmatic description of the thematic
   assessments described above.
