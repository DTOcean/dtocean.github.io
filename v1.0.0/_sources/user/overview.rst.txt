Overall architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The software generated by DTOcean project automates the design of a feasible
array of ocean energy converters (OECs) for a relevant geographical location
and technology type. The design process is modularised into the following
stages:

 * **Hydrodynamics**: designs the layout of converters in a chosen region and
   calculates their power output
 * **Electrical Sub-Systems**: designs an electrical layout for the given
   converter locations and calculates the electrical energy exported to shore
 * **Moorings and Foundations**: designs the foundations and moorings
   required to secure the converters at their given locations
 * **Installation**: designs the installation plan for the energy converters
   and the components required to satisfy the electrical sub-system and
   moorings and foundations designs
 * **Operations and Maintenance**:  calculates the required maintenance
   actions and power losses resulting from the operation of the converters over
   the lifetime of the array

The software can evaluate each stage of the design, and the design as a whole,
using three thematic assessments. These are:

 * **Economics**: produces economic indicators for the design, in particular
   the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)
 * **Reliability**: assesses the reliability of the components in the design
   over the array lifetime
 * **Environmental**: assesses the environmental impact of each stage of the
   design

The challenge and ultimate goal of the project is to optimise the designs
created by the software, LCOE being the priority for the optimisation.

:numref:`fig-functional-structure-user` illustrates the modular nature of the
software and the functionality of each component, in terms of the
user-orientated experience. It consists of five main components:

 * User inputs & selections 
 * A global database
 * A set of computational modules
 * The global decision tool
 * Results
