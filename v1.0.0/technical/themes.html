<h4>8.1.1.1. User Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#user-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The ‘economic assessment’ module takes the array configuration determined by the
design modules previously described and estimates the LCOE for the project. The
LCOE is the indicator used for benchmarking different possible solutions, and
the global optimization routine objective is to minimize it.</p>
<p>Within each design module there are economic functions that calculate the
lifetime costs of the corresponding subsystem. These will be used as input for
the LCOE calculation.</p>
<p>The ‘economic assessment’ module is composed of a set of functions that are used
to calculate the LCOE, which can be called separately or as a whole. It
requires information from all the other modules, as well as user inputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-design-requirements">
<h4>8.1.1.2. Software Design Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#software-design-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For the total LCOE calculation, a list of components used for the project is to
be provided from the other com- putation design modules, with the required
quantities and the related cost, which will have been calculated within each of
these modules or provided by the database or the end-user.</p>
<p>The current ‘economic assessment’ module includes four separate functions,
although “df_lcoe” is the integration of the other three:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>item_total_cost</li>
<li>present_value</li>
<li>simple_lcoe</li>
<li>df_lcoe</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The functions and their interactions with the inputs are presented in a
diagrammatic form in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-arch-economic"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.13</span></a>. A more detailed explanation
of each component can be found further in this document.</p>
<p>The first three functions can take single or multiple values as inputs, while
the last one assumes that the inputs are in the format of pandas tables, with
specific columns.</p>
<p>For the df_lcoe function, two tables are expected as inputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Bill of materials</strong> table, including the following columns:<ul>
<li><strong>item</strong>: identifier column, not used in the function</li>
<li><strong>quantity</strong>: number of units of item</li>
<li><strong>unitary_cost</strong>: cost per unit of the item. It assumes that it
matches the units of the quantity</li>
<li><strong>project_year</strong>: year relative to the start of the project when the
cost occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy output table</strong>, including the following columns:<ul>
<li><strong>project_year</strong>: year relative to the start of the project when the
cost occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)</li>
<li><strong>energy</strong>: final annual energy output. This value accounts for the
hydrodynamic interaction, transmis- sion losses and downtime losses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The other input of the df_lcoe function is the discount rate, which is assumed
to remain constant during the lifetime of the project, and is a single float
value from 0. to 1. to represent the discount rate percentage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h3>8.1.2. Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure" id="id11">
<span id="fig-arch-economic"></span><img alt="../_images/arch_economic.png" src="../_images/arch_economic.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 8.13 </span><span class="caption-text">Detailed flowchart of the economic assessment module</span></p>
</div>
<p>The function <strong>item_total_cost</strong> takes the information of quantity and unitary
cost and calculates the total cost within the context of the array in analysis.
At this stage it is a simple multiplication, but it could be expanded to
account for scaling factors or bulk discounts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the function assumes that all cost data is presented in the right
units to match the quantities, and that the currency is the same. Further
functions dealing with units and currency conversion could be developed.</p>
<p>The cost values can, at most, be grouped by year, as the present value function
will have to be applied before the LCOE calculation. However, it can be
interesting for the user and for the other modules to have the total cost
values detailed by activity (or by design module) or even at an item level.</p>
<p>The function <strong>present_value</strong> transforms any future value into a present value
assuming a specific discount rate. The present value function is applied to
costs and energy output, using the discount rate set by the user. To calculate
the present value of the costs, this function assumes that the total cost has
already been calculated using the previous function. If the year-on-year costs
are equal, the present value can be calculated for lump sums, instead of on an
item by item basis.</p>
<p>The function <strong>simple_lcoe</strong> uses the sum of the present values, as in the
formula below, calculated with the previous function as inputs: sum of all
costs and sum of all energy outputs.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[LCOE = \frac{(CAPEX_0 + OPEX_0) + \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{CAPEX_i + OPEX_i}{(1+r)^i}}{\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{AEP_i}{(1+r)^i}}\]</div>
<p>The function <strong>df_lcoe</strong> takes the preformatted inputs in the format of pandas
DataFrame tables (bill of materials, energy output), as described in the
previous section and applies the previous functions.</p>
<p>For the BoM table, the function creates a new column (‘cost’) for present value
of the total cost, by applying first the item_total_cost function, and then the
present_value one. It then sums all the cost calculated, which will be the
first input for the simple_lcoe function.</p>
<p>For the energy output table, the function creates a new column
(‘discounted_energy’) by applying the present_value function. Like in the
previous table, it then sums all the calculated energy outputs. This sum will
be the second input for the simple_lcoe function.</p>
<p>The output of this function is the LCOE, expressed in €/MWh.</p>
<p>Intermediate or other functions could be developed to evaluate how the LCOE
changes during the project lifetime as an extension to the base functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="functional-specification">
<h3>8.1.3. Functional Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cost of the OEC devices can be provided by the user as an optional input. As
with the other costs assumed in the software, these are expected to be given in
Euro currency.</p>
<p>The discount rate is also to be provided by the user, as it is dependent on the
investor’s valuation of risk and investment opportunities. Typical values of
discount rate for marine energy projects range between 8-15% (Allan et al.,
2011; Andrés et al., 2014; Carbon Trust, 2011, 2006; Ernst &amp; Young and Black &amp;
Veatch, 2010; SQWenergy, 2010) but in LCOE evolution analysis is typical to use
values between 10% and 12% (Carbon Trust, 2006, p. 200; OES, 2015; SI-OCEAN,
2013). More information on the discount rate can be found elsewhere (DTOcean,
2015j).</p>
<p>The dates at which costs are incurred are also required as an input and will be
an output from the Installation and O&amp;M modules. Alternatively, for capital
expenditures, it could be assumed that all costs occur in year zero.</p>
<p>The final input required from the other design modules is the annual energy
output. To the calculation of the LCOE only the final energy output is needed,
which to be provided by the operations and maintenance module after the
downtime has been assessed. However, the input of the LCOE function could also
be the unconstrained energy, but it should be noted that then the LCOE will be
underestimated. There is value is calculating this overoptimistic LCOE, as it
provides a metric on the impact of downtime and other losses calculated by the
software.</p>
<p>The main output of the ‘economic assessment module’ is the LCOE, presented in
terms of €/MWh. Other outputs can be produced from the building blocks of the
LCOE function, such as total lifetime costs (presented in €) and the total
expected electricity production (expressed in MWh).</p>
<div class="section" id="inputs">
<h4>8.1.3.1. Inputs<a class="headerlink" href="#inputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Economics module requires inputs from other modules and from the user. The
inputs from other modules can always be overwritten by the user.</p>
<p>The Bill of Materials is generated by the core from the outputs of the other
design modules. It is formatted as a pandas tables, with the following fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>item</strong>: identifier column, not used in the function</li>
<li><strong>quantity</strong>: number of units of item</li>
<li><strong>unitary_cost</strong>: cost per unit of the item. It assumes that it matches
the units of the quantity</li>
<li><strong>project_year</strong>: year relative to the start of the project when the cost
occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The second set of inputs generated by the tool relates to the energy production.
It also formatted as a pandas table, with the following columns</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>project_year</strong>: year relative to the start of the project when the cost
occurs (from year 0 to the end of the project)</li>
<li><strong>energy</strong>: final annual energy output. This value accounts for the
hydrodynamic interaction, transmission losses and downtime losses</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>project_capacity</strong> input, referring to project capacity in MW, is an
output from the Array Hydrodynamic module, by using the number of devices
output and the user input on device rating.</p>
<p>The inputs <strong>a_energy_wo_elosses</strong> and <strong>a_energy_wo_availability</strong> are outputs
from the the Array hydrodynamic and Electrical sub-systems modules,
respectively. The input a_energy_wo_elosses indicates the average annual
unconstrained energy production, before electrical losses; while
a_energy_wo_availability indicates the average annual energy production
accounting for electrical losses, but without accounting for availability.</p>
<p>From the user, the following inputs are required:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>project_lifetime</strong>: duration of the project in number of years</li>
<li><strong>discount_rate</strong>: discount rate for the project in analysis. The discount
rate is dependent on the investor’s valuation of risk and other investment
opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outputs">
<h4>8.1.3.2. Outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The main output of the economics theme module is the
<strong>levelized cost of energy</strong> (LCOE) of the project, expressed in €/MW. The
building blocks of the LCOE calculation,
<strong>CAPEX, OPEX and Annual Energy Production</strong>, are also outputs of the module</p>
<p>This allows for the representation of the contribution of CAPEX and OPEX to the
LCOE, the contribution of each sub-system/module, or the evaluation per device.</p>

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4>8.2.1.1. User Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Reliability assessment is one of the three main thematic assessment requirements
of the DTOcean software. At first, the design modules (Electrical Sub-Systems
and Moorings and Foundations) will produce a solution which is unconstrained in
terms of environmental impact and reliability but focused on achieving the
lowest possible capital cost. Installation and O&amp;M scheduling will take place
in the respective module by making use of the logistic functions. The role of
the RAM sub-module will be to conduct reliability calculations for i) the user
and ii) to inform operations and maintenance requirements of the O&amp;M module.</p>
<p>The purpose of the RAM is to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Generate a system-level reliability equation based on the
inter-relationships between sub-systems and components (as specified by the
Electrical Sub-Systems and Moorings and Foundations component hierarchies and
by the user)</li>
<li>Provide the user with the opportunity to populate sub-systems not covered by
the DTOcean software (e.g. power take-off, control system) using a GUI-based
Reliability Block Diagram</li>
<li>Consider multiple failure severity classes (i.e. critical and non-critical)
to inform repair action maintenance scheduling. This will represent a
simplified approach to Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)</li>
<li>Carry out normal, optimistic and pessimistic reliability calculations to
determine estimation sensitivity to failure rate variability and quality
analysis</li>
<li>Provide the time-dependent failure estimation model (in the O&amp;M module) with
the Time to failure (TTF) of components within the system</li>

<h4>8.2.1.2. Software Design Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The RAM has been developed to calculate reliability metrics for each component
or sub-system provided by the database and/or user. It is a separate module
which is fed input specified by the user, database and design modules (via the
core for the global design) and provides reliability statistics to the O&amp;M
module and user GUI (again via the Core, see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-reliability"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.14</span></a>).</p>
<p>If a proposed design solution is not feasible in terms of reliability (i.e. it
does not match the threshold set by the user) after the initial run of the
software, an alternative solution will be sought by initializing a subsequent
run of the software. For example, if the reliability of a proposed mooring
system is unacceptable then a constraint could be fed back to the Moorings and
Foundations module. Therefore, only components with a reliability level above a
certain threshold (based on the required level of system reliability set by the
user) would be available for selection when the Moorings and Foundations module
is re-run.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEM HIERARCHY</strong></p>
<p>In order to generate the reliability equations at each system level, component hierarchies defined by the Electrical Sub-Systems and Moorings and Foundations modules (which specify the inter-relationships between components and sub-systems) are used. In addition, any user-specified sub-systems are included at this stage. At the top level of the hierarchy each device will be identified by its DeviceID number. To implement this structure in Python, nested lists have been used, for example the table below shows a simple device and substation foundation example.</p>

<p>It is possible to identify parallel and series relationships from this list
since the component names are separated: series components are separated by a
comma whereas parallel relationships are indicated by square brackets. By
default mooring systems are treated as ‘m of n’ systems (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m=n-1\)</span>)
to represent an Accident Limit State scenario (Det Norske Veritas, 2013a).</p>
<p><strong>FAILURE RATE DATA</strong></p>
<p>Reliability calculations performed within the RAM are based on the assumption
that failures follow an exponential distribution and hence that the hazard rate
is constant with time. Being open-source software, other distributions could be
included in the future to incorporate the two other main life stages (burn-in
and wear-out).</p>
<p>Based on the component names identified in the hierarchy list, failure rates
from the database will then be accessed. Failure data for certain components
may be sparse. A review8 of mooring component failures of production and
non-production platforms and vessels illustrates this point. Most,
if not all of these failures can be classified as critical: although redundancy
is usually taken into account while designing these types of mooring systems,
immediate intervention would be required to regain system integrity.
Assumptions will have to be made if data is not available for all components
(i.e. using the failure rates of similar components or sub-systems).</p>
<div class="figure" id="id17">
<span id="tab-failures"></span><img alt="../_images/failures.png" src="../_images/failures.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 8.19 </span><span class="caption-text">Reported non-production mooring failures 1981-2009 and estimated probability of failure (based on a 30 year interval)</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>FAILURE TYPES</strong></p>
<p>Clearly not all failures will result in system downtime and some may be
sufficiently minor to warrant delaying replacement until the next maintenance
interval. The OREDA Offshore Reliability Data Handbook (OREDA, 2009) which is
widely used in the offshore oil and gas industry defines three failure severity
levels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Critical failure – a failure which causes immediate and complete loss of an
equipment unit’s capability of providing its output</li>
<li>Degraded failure – a failure which is not critical but prevents the unit
from providing its output within specifications. Such a failure would
usually, but not necessarily, be gradual or partial, and may develop into a
critical failure in time</li>
<li>Incipient failure – a failure which does not immediately cause loss of an
equipment unit’s capacity of providing its output, but which, if not attend
to, could result in a critical or degraded failure in the near future</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the RAM, two failure mode categories are used to distinguish between the
different consequences of failure: i) critical and ii) non-critical
(encompassing failures described by the ‘degraded’ and ‘incipient’ definitions
above). The corresponding parameters are failratecrit and failratenoncrit.</p>
<p>Within the O&amp;M module, O&amp;M scheduling will be based on the probability of
failure, failure mode and required repair action. Two runs of the RAM will be
conducted using the different failure rates associated with critical or
non-critical severity levels. This is effectively a simplified version of FMEA,
but assumes that all failures are independent (i.e. there are no cascade
failures).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is unlikely that failure data will be available for all severity
classes. Therefore, by default RAM calculations are based on failure rates
associated with the highest available severity levels, with subsequent runs
utilising lower severity level values (where available).</p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE LEVELS</strong></p>
<p>Failure rates are often specified as single values, which usually correspond to
a calculated mean of many samples, possibly from multiple installations. A
single value does not provide any information on the variability of component
reliability over multiple installations (or the presence of outlying failures)
which could have a significant impact on the overall MTTF of the system and
associated system downtime and costs. Uncertainty levels provide a measure of
confidence of the baseline failure rate. If upper and lower uncertainty levels
are specified, the RAM functions will be called several times using lower, mean
and upper level failure rates. Therefore failratecrit and failratenoncrit are 1
x 3 vectors for each component. Three estimation scenarios are hence provided,
which are ‘optimistic’, ‘normal’ and ‘pessimistic’ from which the sensitivity
of lifecycle costs over the duration of the project can be analysed.</p>
<p>In addition to performing calculations with lower, mean and upper uncertainty
level failure rates, these values will be reported to the user to enable the
quality of the estimate if the sample population (which the failure rate is
based upon).</p>

<h4>8.2.2.2. Result sets and the O&amp;M module<a class="headerlink" href="#result-sets-and-the-o-m-module" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Considering the two severity levels (ULS, ALS) and three failure rate confidence
levels (upper, mean andlower) introduced in above, six result sets are
generated by the RAM. It is highly unlikely, given the current state of the MRE
sector, that failure rate data will be available for all six factors for all
components. To cater for the situation where data is limited for some
components, runs of the RAM for lower and upper uncertainty levels and
non-critical failures will use mean, critical failure rates for these
components. This enables full system analysis to be conducted even if a
complete set of data is not available. The time domain calculations which take
place within the O&amp;M module are computationally demanding in terms of the time
required to simulate failure events for all components in a system. To avoid
the need to analyse all of the six result sets from the RAM, the O&amp;M module
will only focus on a ‘best’ and ‘worst’ case scenario related to highest and
lowest calculated TTFs.</p>
<p>The base design of the module does not contain an optimisation function; it
simply calculates reliability metrics based on the provided information. An
extension could be provided so that if the calculated MTTF of the system does
not meet the user-specified target, the RAM will try to identify which part of
the system can be improved in terms of reliability (i.e. which sub-system has
the lowest overall reliability) and request that changes are made by the
corresponding module (Moorings and Foundations or Electrical Sub-Systems). Once
changes have been made (i.e. replacing a component with a more reliable, but
perhaps more costly equivalent) the RAM will be rerun.</p>

<p>The main outputs of the RAM are component MTTFs (which are used by the O&amp;M

information is presented to the user via a tree structure. The tree provides a
breakdown of the calculated system reliability into sub-system and component

with low reliability). The following information is provided in the tree
structure:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li>MTTF</li>
<li>Risk priority numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk priority numbers are calculated within the RAM based on the frequency of

defined by estimated probability of failure ranges
(<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-failure-freq"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.21</span></a>). RPNs increase with failure frequency and severity

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>8.3.1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is to assess the
environmental impacts generated by the various technological choices taken by
the design modules when optimising an array of OEC devices.</p>
<p>The EIA consists of a set of functions that are able to qualify and quantify the
potential pressures generated by the array of wave or tidal devices on the
marine environment. It uses two types of inputs. Some data will have to be
provided by the user; other data will come directly from the other modules
(e.g. Hydrodynamics, Electrical architecture, Moorings and Foundations etc.).</p>
<p>The EIA is based on several scoring principles which are detailed in this
chapter of the Technical Manual. In summary, the use of the environmental
functions allows the EIA to generate numerical values that will be converted
into environmental scores (EIS - Environmental Impact Score). The conversion
from the function’ scores to the environmental scores are made through
calibration matrices. Each function is associated with one calibration matrix
(or several depending on the complexity of the function) in order to qualify
the initial pressure score. Calibration matrices are based on literature data
or empirical data together with a weighting protocol which is implemented in
the EIA logic to better qualify the environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The scoring allocation system developed within the DTOcean framework is generic
for each environmental function and based in three consecutive main steps. The
first step consists of qualifying and quantifying the ‘pressure’ generated by
all components introduced in the the water. This could be, for example, the
generation of underwater noise or a footprint from the device foundations. The
second step is to define if there are some ‘receptors’ or not in the area that
is potentially affected by the pressures generated in the first step. Receptors
can be mammals, birds or habitats. Within the receptors, some distinctions are
made depending on their sensitivities to the pressures. Some receptors are also
identified as ‘very sensitive’ e.g. regulatory protected species. The last step
consists of a refinement of the receptor’s qualification with the definition of
their seasonal distribution (occurrence or absence on site during the year).</p>
<p>The EIA should inform the user about the ‘environmental impact’, including
adverse but also potentially positive impact, of the technological choices and
options made during each individual design module, as well as their combined
effect.</p>
<p>Recommendations based on the pressure and the receptor’s score are provided to
the user to help improve the environmental impact of the proposed array using
more environmental friendly solutions.</p>

<h3>8.3.2. Global Concept of the Module<a class="headerlink" href="#global-concept-of-the-module" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Environmental risk assessment is a process that estimates the likelihood and
consequence of adverse (or positive) environmental impacts (United States
Environmental Protection Agency, 2015). In that regard, conceptual model
development is critical to assessing the environmental risk. The approach used
here is based on the concept of environmental effects generated by ‘stressors’
and the related exposure of ‘receptors’ to these effects. A stressor is any
physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse response.
Stressors may adversely affect specific natural resources or entire ecosystems,
including plants and animals, as well as the environment with which they
interact. A receptor is any environmental feature, usually an ecological
entity. Examples of stressors and receptors associated with tidal energy
developments given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-stressors"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.24</span></a> (Polagye et al., 2011).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 8.24 </span><span class="caption-text">Example of environmental stressors and receptors associated with tidal energy developments (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2015)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Within this framework, it is therefore a matter to systematically identify and
evaluate the relationships between all stressors and their impact on receptors.
In order to achieve this, a set of environmental functions have been
specifically designed, as well as a scoring system to build a framework of
scenarios that are able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Qualitatively and quantitatively characterise the effects of the different
stressors for tidal and wave array developments</li>
<li>Quantitatively estimate exposure (and risk) to receptors</li>
<li>Provide environmental impact assessment estimates (through the scoring
system) to inform array design decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this conceptual approach, when assessing the environmental impacts the
array development phases are collection into two groups as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Installation, O&amp;M and decommissioning phases</li>
<li>Exploitation phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the installation, O&amp;M and decommissioning phases often generate
significant but short-term impacts, whilst the impact of the exploitation phase
is often lower in magnitude but occur over a longer time period.</p>

<h3>8.3.3. Environmental Functions Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-functions-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to assess the potential environmental impacts of tidal and wave arrays
for these two phases, a set of generic environmental issues have been
specifically selected and described. These are shown in

<p>Each issue is specifically allocated to the different DTOcean modules
(Hydrodynamics, Electrical Sub- Systems, Mooring and Foundations…), as each
module generates different stressors depending on its purpose.
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-env-modules"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.26</span></a> shows which issues are assessed for each of the

<h3>8.3.5. Environmental Functions Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order for the user to have both a global environmental assessment and
detailed information when using the DTOcean software, two levels (L1 and L2) of
results will be available within the software. The relationships between the
levels will also be made available. At each level, adverse and positive impacts
are always given separately. The different display levels are defined as follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Level 1: The first level of assessment provides a global (agglomerated) EIS
given for each module. The result for each module is generated by the
summation of EIS obtained by each function selected for that specific module
and normalised on the scal e ranging from +50 to -100. This level also
contains the range of impacts associated with the EIS for each module. A
graphical example of the level 1 results is given in

<ul class="simple">
<li>Level 2: The second level provides full details at the function level. This
level also contains the level of confidence associated to the EIS for each

<p>By default for the summation purpose (going from L2 to L1), all
functions and modules have the same weight. However, the user will have the

<div class="section" id="software-requirements">
<h3>8.3.6. Software requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#software-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The scoring allocation system developed within the EIA is generic for each
environmental function and is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-env-scoring-tech"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.30</span></a>. The main
principle for the different steps is summarised below and is based on three
main steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>STEP 1: quantification of the ‘pressure’ generated by the stressors</strong></p>
<p>The quantification of the pressure is obtained from the environmental
functions selected and the produced Pressure Score (PS). The PS is then
adjusted to a new numerical value called the Pressure Score adjusted (PSa)
through a ‘weighting protocol’ by multiplying the PS with a coefficient
ranging from 0 and 1. This happens if local environmental factors exist,
which are independent from the receptors, and are not included in the
function’s formula. If no weighting is selected, a default value of 1 used.</p>
<p>At this stage the level of confidence is at its lowest value of 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>STEP 2: basic qualification of the occurrence (or absence) of receptors</strong></p>
<p>The second step is triggered if the user is able to indicate the existence
of receptors onsite. Step 2 uses the score initially generated in step 1 and
then adjusts it depending on the receptor’s sensitivity by multiplying the
PSa with the Receptor Sensitivity coefficient (RS), which ranges from 0 to 5,
unless the user has no receptor data, in which case the RS is assumed to be
at its maximum value 5. This process leads to the Receptor Sensitivity Score
(RSS). The different receptors are gathered within main classes reflecting
their sensitivity to pressure. The user will have to choose between these
different main classes of receptors that will be characterised by having RS
values ranging from 0 to 5 for low to high sensitivity, respectively. When
several receptors are identified onsite, the most sensitive receptors will be
considered for the EIS calculations. To ultimately obtain the EIS a linear
mapping is applied and specific calibration tables are used to convert RSS to
EIS. In the case where the user declares a receptor that is regulatory
protected (list provided by the database), by default this will automatically
lead to an EIS of -100.</p>
<p>If the user is able to provide details about the existence of receptors, the
level of confidence increases to medium, corresponding to the value 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>STEP 3: qualification of the seasonal distribution of receptors</strong></p>
<p>The last step is triggered if the user has monthly data for the existence of
receptors onsite. The step then modulates the final EIS to take into account
less sensitive receptors when the highest sensitive receptors are declared
absent. Step 3 is similar to step 2 for each specific receptor declared
onsite and the EIS is equal to 0 for any receptors absent in a particular
month. For each month, the EIS is given by the most sensitive species present.</p>
<p>If the user has such monthly data, the level of confidence is at its highest
value of 3.</p>

</div>
<p>The implementation of the requirements detailed in this section is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-robustness-env"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.38</span></a>. The main component of this system is the Logigram
class that creates a programmatic representation of the flow chart shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-env-scoring-tech"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8.30</span></a>. A single subclass of the Logigram class exists
for each environmental function detailed in the previous section. These are
loaded from a module containing all the programmatic definitions of the
function, the module being called the same.</p>
<p>Each Logigram contains three subclasses of the class Score. A score class
contains a Python pandas table that carries all the scores which are used to
amalgamate the result of the environmental function result and the observations
of receptors or other sensitive items that weight of the function output. The
column names of the tables in each Score subclass can vary, so it is the
responsibility of the subclasses to check the format of the entered data.</p>
<p>The values for these tables are retrieved from files which are stored alongside
the source code for the module (in JSON format, for instance). It was chosen to
store these values locally, rather than in the global database as the values
are extremely sensitively balanced and modification by an unexperienced user
would be undesirable. A special boundary class called LoadScores is available
to help collect the scores from the files and load them into Logigram classes.</p>
<p>The EIA boundary class is used to trigger each Logigram subclass as required. As
the volume of input data can vary depending on which modules are run, the
Logigram classes contain an abstract property called “trigger_identifiers”
which returns a list of identifiers (related to the definitions of the
functions, not the DDS) that can be accessed by the EIA class. As the input
data to the EIA is given in the form of a dictionary, it can check the
identifiers against each of the Logigram subclasses it contains and activate
them as appropriate.</p>
<p>Each Logigram produces an Assessment class to store its results and these are
returned to the EIA class following execution. The EIA class then has methods
to amalgamate the results related to the type of impact (see Table 7.6) and
create an overall global assessment. The user of the software can then access
each of these various levels of information.</p>

<p>A single Logigram class can be prepared for completing an isolated assessment
for one function as defined in Appendix L. A UML class diagram of the abstract
Logigram class is given in Figure 7.15. To create a concrete class for a
specific function, four methods must be overloaded. An example of supplying
these methods for the energy modification function is shown in Figure 7.16.
Although this process has already been completed for all the functions required
for the DTOcean software, it is useful to see that extending these functions is
a straightforward process.</p>

<h4>8.3.8.2. Initialising a Logigram subclass<a class="headerlink" href="#initialising-a-logigram-subclass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once a concrete subclass of the Logigram class is created it must be initialised
with data representing the scoring of each component of the flow chart shown in
figure 7.4.5. These scores are collected in subclasses of the Score class, in
order to ensure the format of the given data is correct. For example, building
an ImpactScore class is undertaken as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">impact_score_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;impact&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">],</span>
                     <span class="s2">&quot;score&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">impact_score</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ImpactScore</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">impact_score_dict</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The process is similar for creating the WeightingScore and ReceptorScore
objects, ensuring that the correct columns are given. Once these three objects
are created, it is straightforward to initialise the Logigram class, as so:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">energy_modification</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">EnergyModification</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">impact_score</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                         <span class="n">weighting_score</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                         <span class="n">receptor_score</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As with the definitions of the Logigram subclasses, it is not anticipated that a
standard user would wish to modify the scores provided alongside the code.
Should they wish to load a Logigram subclass with the stored values, a helper
class is provided called LoadScores. The LoadScores class uses a path to the
location of the stored files. The resulting objects takes an uninitialised
Logigram subclass and return an initialised object containing the stored score
values. A default path for the score file will also be stored within the
LoadScores class, making it very easy to use. For example, to initialise an
EnergyModification object requires just the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">loader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">LoadScores</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>Executing a Logigram object is simply a matter of supplying the necessary
inputs. The input relating to the specific impact is unique to the Logigram
subclass being used; however the inputs are always entered in a similar manner,
using a Python dictionary. Additionally, a list of observed protected species
and a dictionary containing observations for species subclasses can be given.
The keys of this dictionary relate to the subclass itself, and the values allow
per month observations. If these monthly observations are not known then the
value “None” indicates they are known to be present, but it is not known when
they are present. Using the EnergyModification Logigram subclass as an example

<p>The output of the call to the energy_modication object is an object of the
Assessment class. This class standardises the outputs of the assessments so
they can be combined easily. In general, they contain the following attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>impact_type</strong>: the class of impact which contains this function</li>
<li><strong>score</strong>: the combined score for the function (+ve or –ve depending on the
type)</li>
<li><strong>confidence_level</strong>: the level of confidence depending on the known data</li>
<li><strong>impact_scores</strong>: a dictionary detailing the impact score calculation</li>
<li><strong>protected_scores</strong>: a dictionary detailing the scores for protected species</li>
<li><strong>basic_receptor_scores</strong>: a table detailing the scores relating to
non-temporal subspecies observations</li>
<li><strong>temporal_receptor_scores</strong>: a table detailing the scores relating to
temporal subspecies observations</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.3.8.4. Using the EIA Class to Combine Impacts<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-eia-class-to-combine-impacts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The EIA class allows many Logigram subclasses to be executed at once, in
response to the data available. It can also combine those assessments to
produce aggregated scores for impact types and an overall score for all of the
impacts.</p>
<p>An EIA class can be initialised with a list of Logigram subclass objects which
have been initialised as described above. This EIA class is then ready to use
in a very similar manner to the individual Logigram subclasses, except that the
impacts dictionary is expanded to include all of the variables that relate to
impact scores. An example of creating and executing an EIA class object is as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">environmental_assessment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">EIA</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">energy_assessment</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                <span class="n">seaborn_impact_risk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">])</span>

<span class="n">all_assessments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">environmental_assessment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">impacts</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                           <span class="n">protected_observations</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                           <span class="n">subclass_observations</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output “all_assessments” is a dictionary where the keys are the name of the
impact (retrieved with the “get_impact_name” method) and the values are the
Assessment objects related to that particular impact. The EIA class has three
further functions for amalgamating the assessment scores. These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>type_scores: generates scores and confidence levels per impact type</li>
<li>local_score: generates a total score and confidence level for a single module</li>
<li>global_score: generates a global total score for all the modules</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two functions take the dictionary output of the EIA call
(all_assessments), but the last function takes a list of all the local scores
which are required to be combined into the overall global assessment.</p>
